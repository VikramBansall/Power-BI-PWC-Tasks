Task 2: Customer Retention

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk
We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.
